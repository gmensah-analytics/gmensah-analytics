# Hi, I'm Gamal

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! This is where curiosity meets code, business problems get solved, and I share the tools that make data analysis truly enjoyable.

## About Me

I'm a Toronto-based data analyst with a background in business transformation, product development, consumer insights, and workflow automation. I specialize in making data actionable through exploratory data analysis, whether it's surfacing retention patterns, building dashboards, or automating repetitive reporting. 

My analysis doesn't just show what's happening, it reveals why it matters and what to do about it. Stakeholders walk away ready to act, not just informed.

I'm curious by nature, find patterns in data, rhythm in code, and derive joy in building things that work, whether that‚Äôs a reporting dashboard or my cleverly wired smart home setup. When I‚Äôm not solving for insight, I‚Äôm probably out exploring Toronto‚Äôs hidden corners or deep in a conversation about music, travel, my favourite pizza, or what makes a great espresso.
